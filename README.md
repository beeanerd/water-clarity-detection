# Water Clarity Detection
This project aims to automatically provide a numerical value to gague water quality using only an image and a ruler. The processing will be done client side through a mobile app, but a web implementation is also planned where an image will be allowed to be uploaded.  
### Working
- Ruler spacing detection

- Image thresholding (preprocessing)
- Ruler segmentation along areas of interest
- Blur scoring detection
### Not Working
- Automatically determining areas of interest
- Clean edge detection
- Mobile/Web implementation
- Ruler scaling
- Clarity scoring
